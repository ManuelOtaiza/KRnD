# KRnD: Kerbal Research & Development

## Introduction

*Kerbal Research & Development* (or KRnD) is a mod for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com), which aims at giving the player a more interesting end-game experience. With this mod you can spend science-points to improve the stats of unlocked parts such as the mass or engine-efficiency, giving you a good reason to bring back every single last bit of science from your deep-space missions that you can.

At the moment you can improve the following stats::
+ Dry mass of all parts (reduced mass of a part when empty)
+ Atmospheric or vacuum ISP of Engines (improving their fuel efficiency)
+ Fuel flow of Engines and RCS-Thrusters (increasing their thrust)
+ Torque of reaction wheels
+ Charge rate of solar panels
+ Crash tolerance of landing legs
+ Battery capacity
+ Efficiency of Generators (eg RTGs)
+ Efficiency of Resource Converters
+ Deployment-speed for Parachutes
+ Maximum internal- and skin-temperature
+ Fuel pressure (capacity of fuel tanks)

Please note that this mod is not 100% compatible with other mods which modify parts at runtime (eg TweakScale or FuelSwitch).
